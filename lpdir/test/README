test
This directory contains various files used in the testing of LP.
The files break down into various groups:

		Worked examples
Worked examples are generated by running the file testinp
("lp < testinp")  This runs the worked examples in the files
we and wep.  (wep is in the higher directory).  This run produces
5 dumpN files; dump2, dump3, dump4, dump5 and dump6.  Each dumpN
file contains the new information learned up to and including
the Nth example.  (dumpM is a subset of dumpN for M < N.)  These files
are simply a convenient way of bringing the bare LP up to a desired
level without running the worked examples.

		Problem Sets

The file newrun.pl contains a large number of sample problems
and clauses to run them.  Compiling this file in LP and typing
"test(1)." runs the problems suitable for standard LP.
Replacing 1 with another number from 2 to 6 makes LP consult
the relevant dumpN file and run a (probably slightly bigger)
test set.  

The files lpexam and lpexam.new contain together a super set
of the problems in newrun.pl.  Someday, LP may run them all.

		Control

bigtest, which should be executable (if not type "chmod +x bigtest" to the
Unix prompt) runs all the tests from 1 to 6, using the files
first, second third etc, recording information from test to test via the 
file bigstats.
