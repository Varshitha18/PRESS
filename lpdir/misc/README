This directory is mainly concerned with cross-reference stuff.
Using the Quintus cross referencer (xref), load lp.ccl to do a cross
reference of the LP files.  Note that the path names in this file,
and in lp.def will probably need to be changed for your implementation.

xrefload, which should be executable, can produce a cross-reference,
by typing "xref < xrefload" to the unix prompt.

lp.cng lists changes made to lp.  (Probably blank!)

lp.sts  lists some (probably out of date) statistics the
number of clauses and predicates that make up  LP.

This information is generated by the count program.  Compile
count.pl into Prolog.  This generates a saved state called count 
in /usr/local/bin/count.  Run this and type "lp" to the Next file
prompt.  When the prompt occurs again, hit return.
