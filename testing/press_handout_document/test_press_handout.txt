Solving log(2, x) + 4 * log(x, 2) = 5 for x

Rewriting equation in terms of log(2, x)
gives log(2, x) + 4 * log(2, x) ^ -1 = 5

Substituting   x1 for log(2, x) gives
 4 * x1 ^ -1 + x1 = 5

Multiply through by x1 to get 

x1 ^ 2 + -5 * x1 + 4 = 0

Using quadratic equation formula

Solutions are x1 = 4 and x1 = 1

Applying substitution 
    x1 = log(2, x)

   to    : 
    x1 = 4 # x1 = 1

   gives : 
    log(2, x) = 4 # log(2, x) = 1



Solving disjunct log(2, x) = 4

    x = 16

Solving disjunct log(2, x) = 1

    x = 2
     (by Isolation)

Answer is : 
(X1 # X2)
  where :
    X1 =  x = 16
    X2 =  x = 2

true.
